# Shortest-Path-Using-Directed-Graph
  This C++ program demonstrates the application of dynamic programming to find the shortest path in a directed graph. 
  It efficiently calculates the optimal cost of traversing from a starting point to an ending point, along with the
   optimal path.

Usage:

The cost matrix represents the costs of traveling from one point to another in the directed graph.
The find_optimal_path function calculates the optimal cost and trace path using dynamic programming.
The optimal cost and path are displayed to the user, providing insights into the shortest path and associated costs
